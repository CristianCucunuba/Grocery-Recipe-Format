# Welcome to Recipes!

> Grocery now supports Recipes! A recipe can be anything you want it to be; a list of frequently purchased items that you want to conveniently add to your grocery list, a #tagged meal someone shared with you, or a passed down family recipe. #welcome

> You’ll notice that the first item in the recipe is the title of the recipe. Titles are also the file name of the recipe in iCloud Drive.

> You’ll also notice that the second item of the recipe appears in the recipe list to help remind you what this recipe is. You can tap on #tags in the list to filter your recipes and search for specific recipes. Tags are basically groups, so use anything you want to: #salad #dinner #cookies #family etc.

## This is a header. You can create headers to organize your recipe into sections representing groups of ingredients and steps.

- Ingredient | This is an item. An item is an ingredient in your recipe that can be conveniently added to your grocery list. Notes added here are also added to the item in your grocery list. | 

This is a step. Steps are the instructions for your recipe. You’ll notice that steps can be anywhere you want them to be, like in between items. That’s because steps are most useful when they’re next to the ingredients they apply to.

> You can check off steps and items by tapping on them to remind you where you’re at while cooking the recipe.

- Potatoes | Put things here to remind you how many potatoes to use in the recipe, and what type (so that you know what to buy). | Put things here to remind you what to do with the potatoes for the recipe, like wash, slice, or peel them.

Sometimes you need to know how long to wait for something. You can write down the time in your step, like a reminder for 30 minutes, and Grocery will create a timer to notify you when it’s ready.

> By the way, these are notes. Notes are handy for lots of things, like explaining how to create recipes in Grocery, and describing an optional step in a recipe or including an alternate ingredient if one type of item isn’t available.

> Other ideas for notes are for specifying where a recipe came from, or how many servings it provides or how long it takes to make. Like steps and items, you can put notes anywhere you want.

> The button below adds the recipe to your meal plan. The recipe list provides quick access at the top to planned recipes. Adding a recipe to your meal plan also let’s you add the ingredients to your grocery list. You can perform both actions from the ••• menu as well.
